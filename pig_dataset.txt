1. What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributer?
a = load '/home/jayant/dataset.txt' using PigStorage (',') as
(district:chararray, name:chararray, buy_rate:chararray,
sell_rate:chararray, volumeIn:int, volumeOut:int, year:int);
b = group a by name;
c = foreach b generate group, SUM(a.volumeOut);
Store c into '/home/jayant/volumesold';

2. Which are the top 10 distributers ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of
petrol sold in volume.
a = load '/home/jayant/dataset.txt' using PigStorage (',') as
(district:chararray, name:chararray, buy_rate:chararray,
sell_rate:chararray, volumeIn:int, volumeOut:int, year:int);
d = group a by district;
e = foreach d generate group, SUM(a.volumeOut) as sum;
ord = order e by sum;
f = limit ord 10;
g = foreach f generate $0;
Store g into '/home/jayant/bigsellid';

3. List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.
a = load '/home/jayant/dataset.txt' using PigStorage (',') as
(district:chararray, name:chararray, buy_rate:chararray,
sell_rate:chararray, volumeIn:int, volumeOut:int, year:int);
d = group a by year;
e = foreach d generate group, ditrict,
SUBTRACT(a.volumeIn,a.volumeOut) as difference;
i = order e by difference;
f = limit i 10;
g = foreach f generate $0;
Store g into '/home/jayant/bigyear';

4. Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount.
a = load '/home/jayant/dataset.txt' using PigStorage (',') as
(district:chararray, name:chararray, buy_rate:chararray,
sell_rate:chararray, volumeIn:int, volumeOut:int, year:int);
d = group a by name;
e = foreach d generate group, SUBTRACT(a.volumeOut,a.volumeIn) as difference;
i = order e by difference;
f = limit i;
g = foreach f generate $0;
Store g into '/home/jayant/bigname';
